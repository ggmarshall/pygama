"""
Contains a list of dsp processors used by the legend experiment, implemented
using numba's guvectorize to implement numpy's ufunc interface. In other words,
all of the functions are void functions whose outputs are given as parameters.
The ufunc interface provides additional information about the function
signatures that enables broadcasting the arrays and SIMD processing. Thanks to
the ufunc interface, they can also be called to return a numpy array, but if
this is done, memory will be allocated for this array, slowing things down.

The pygama processors use the
[ufunc](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/ufuncs.html) framework,
which is designed to encourage highly performant python practices. Ufuncs have
several advantages:

1. Ufuncs work with [numpy
arrays](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/arrays.html). Numpy arrays
are arrays of same-typed objects that are stored adjacently in memory
(equivalent to a dynamically allocated C-array or a C++ vector). Compared to
standard python lists, they perform computations much faster. They are ideal
for representing waveforms and transformed waveforms.

2. Ufuncs perform vectorized operations. Vectorization causes commands to
perform the same operation on all components of an array. For example, the
ufunc `np.add(a, b, out=c)` (equivalently `c=a+b`) is equivalent to:
```
for i in range(len(c)):
    c[i] = a[i] + b[i]
```
Loops are slow in python since it is an interpreted language; vectorized
commands remove the loop and only call the python interpreter once.

Furthermore, ufuncs are capable of
[broadcasting](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/ufuncs.html#broadcasting)
their dimensions. This involves a safety check to ensure the dimensions of `a`
and `b` are compatible sizes. It also will automatically replicate a size-1
dimension over another one, enabling the addition of a scalar to a vector
quantity. This is useful, as it allows us to process multiple waveforms at
once.

One of the biggest advantages of vectorized ufuncs is that many of them will
take advantage of SIMD (same input-multiple data) vectorization on a
vector-CPU. Modern CPUs typically have 256- or 512-bit wide processing units,
which can accommodate multiple 32- or 64-bit numbers. Programming with these,
however, is quite difficult and requires specialized commands to be called.
Luckily for us, many numpy ufuncs will automatically use these for us, speeding
up our code!

3. Ufuncs are capable of calculating their output in place, meaning they can
place calculated values in pre-allocated memory rather than allocating and
returning new values. This is important because memory allocation is one of the
slowest processes computers can perform, and should be avoided. With ufuncs,
this can be done using the out keyword in arguments (ex `np.add(a, b, out=c)`,
or more succinctly, `np.add(a, b, c)`). While this may seem counterintuitive at
first, the alternative (`c = np.add(a,b)` or `c = a+b`) causes an entirely new
array to be allocated, with c pointing at that. These array allocations can add
up very quickly: `e = a*b + c*d`, for example, would allocate 3 different
arrays: one for `a*b`, one for `c*d`, and one for the sum of those two. As we
write ufuncs to use for LEGEND, it is important that we try to use functions
that operate in place as much as possible!
